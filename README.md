# Clean Jokes from the Internet
A curated, edited collection of mostly clean jokes from the internet. The target age group is children around the ages of 9-12. I left out some of the more technical clean jokes from IT, science, music, etc. I also tried to ensure that all of the grammar is correct, that all of the jokes are written in the present tense, and that all of the verbs are active voice.

If you want another format, pandoc is your friend.
