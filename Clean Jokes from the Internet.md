Doctors {#doctors .unnumbered}
=======

Hearing Problem {#hearing-problem .unnumbered}
---------------

A man goes to his doctor and says, “I don’t think my wife’s hearing is
as good as it used to be. What should I do?”

The doctor replies, “Try this test to find out for sure. When your wife
is in the kitchen doing dishes, stand fifteen feet behind her and ask
her a question, if she doesn’t respond keep moving closer, asking the
question until she hears you.”

The man goes home and sees his wife preparing dinner. He stands fifteen
feet behind her and says, “What’s for dinner, honey?” He gets no
response, so he moves to ten feet behind her and asks again. Still no
response, so he moves to five feet. Still no answer. Finally he stands
directly behind her and says, “Honey, what’s for dinner?” She replies,
“For the fourth time, I SAID WE ARE HAVING CHICKEN!”

Mad Doctor {#mad-doctor .unnumbered}
----------

When does a doctor get mad?

When he runs out of patients!

Time to Live {#time-to-live .unnumbered}
------------

An older fellow is talking to his doctor. He asks the doc,

“How long do I have?”

“10”

“10 what?”

“9”

“8”…

Bad News {#bad-news .unnumbered}
--------

At the doctor’s office, Tom is getting a check up.

“I have good news and bad news,” says the doctor. “The good news is you
have 24 hours left to live.”

Tom replies, “That’s the good news?!”

The doctor says, “The bad news is I should have told you that
yesterday.”

Poor Hamster {#poor-hamster .unnumbered}
------------

A man goes to the vet with a hamster. It’s cold and very, very still,
and the man looks desperate.

“You have to help me!” he says to the vet. “It’s Hammy the Hamster! He’s
very ill.”

The vet takes a look, gets his stethoscope out and checks. He replies,
“I’m so sorry. I’m afraid this hamster is dead.”

“Nooooo!” cries the man. “Not Hammy! He can’t be! He was running around
just fine this morning!”

“I’m afraid he is dead, sir. I’m terribly sorry.”

“I don’t believe you! I want a second opinion!” shouts the man. He’s
obviously very agitated.

“If you’re sure, sir.” replies the vet, and opens a door. A small tabby
cat walks into the room, jumps up on the examination table, and looks at
the hamster. He pokes it a bit with his paw, licks the hamster in the
face, and looks up at the vet and shakes his head.

“I’m afraid that’s conclusive, sir.” says the vet, as the tabby jumped
down and walked out of the door. “This hamster is dead.”

“I can’t take it in!” shouts the man. He’s even more agitated. “I still
don’t believe you. Isn’t there anything else you can do to check?”

“If you’re sure, sir.” says the vet and opens another door. This time, a
labrador walks in, hops up on the examination table, and looks at the
hamster. He nuzzles it with his nose, sniffs it carefully, and looks up
at the vet with big, sad eyes and shakes his head.

“I’m so very sorry sir.” says the vet. The man looks defeated.

“I suppose it must be true.” says the man.

“I’m afraid so. And I have some more bad news - that’s going to be
\$1200.00.”

“What? You’re charging me that much just to tell me my hamster is dead?”

“Well, it would have been free, sir - but you did insist on the cat scan
and the lab work.”

Dieting {#dieting .unnumbered}
-------

A man is terribly overweight, so his doctor puts him on a diet.

“I want you to eat regularly for 2 days, then skip a day, and repeat
this procedure for two weeks. The next time I see you, you’ll have lost
at least 5 pounds.”

When the man returns, he shocks the doctor by losing nearly twenty
pounds.

“Why, that’s amazing!” the doctor says, “Did you follow my
instructions?”

The man nods. “I’ll tell you, though, I thought I was going to drop dead
that third day.”

“From hunger, you mean?”

“No, from all the skipping.”

Johnny {#johnny .unnumbered}
======

Geometry {#geometry .unnumbered}
--------

A teacher asks, “Johnny, make up a sentence using the word, ‘geometry.’”

Johnny replies, “An acorn grew until it finally looked at itself one day
and said, ‘Gee, I’m a tree.’”

Beans {#beans .unnumbered}
-----

A teacher asks her students to use the word “beans” in a sentence.

“My father grows beans,” says one girl. “My mother cooks beans,” says a
boy.

Johnny speaks up, “We are all human beans.”

Home Early {#home-early .unnumbered}
----------

One day, Johnny gets home early from school and his mom asks, “Why are
you home so early?”

He answers, “Because I was the only one that answered a question in my
class.”

His mom says, “Wow! My son is a genius! What was the question?”

Johnny replies, “The question was ’Who threw the trash can at the
principal?”’

Stupid {#stupid .unnumbered}
------

A teacher says to his class one day, “Anyone who thinks they’re stupid,
please stand up.”

Nobody stands up, so the teacher says, “I’m sure there are some students
in this class that think they’re stupid!”

At this point, Johnny stands up.

The teacher says, “Oh Johnny! So you think you’re stupid then?”

Johnny replies, “No, I just feel bad that you are standing up on your
own.”

Poor Johnny {#poor-johnny .unnumbered}
-----------

Mr. Smith, a very wealthy man, is in town on business. Towards the end
of his trip, he decides to take a walk on the docks to take in the ocean
view.

As he’s walking, he comes upon a young boy, maybe twelve years old,
crying on the edge of the dock. Mr. Smith hesitates, but decides to ask
what’s wrong.

“Excuse me, son? Why are you crying?” he asks gently.

The boy wipes away his tears and replies, “Oh, there’s just a lot of
things going wrong in my life right now. I’m sorry if I bothered you.”

Mr. Smith takes note of the boy’s politeness, “Is there anything I can
do to help? Why don’t you tell me what’s going on...”

With that, the boy breaks down and sobs. He starts describing his
troubles. His mother is dying of cancer and can’t work. They can’t
afford the medicine to manage her symptoms. They haven’t eaten in days.
Not even an hour ago, the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a
restaurant for food and was caned by the owner. He tried to go home to
his mother, but when he got there, he saw an eviction notice on the
door, and he just couldn’t bring himself to go inside to give her the
news. Everything is falling apart, and he can’t take it. “So I came here
and cried,” he finished.

Mr. Smith is shocked. Of all the people he could have encountered, he
encountered this boy. He could solve this boy’s problems with a single
cheque. But Mr. Smith is a firm believer in earning what you get, no
matter what it is. As the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to
the water.

“Son,” Mr. Smith begins, “what’s your name?”

“My name is Johnny,” the boy says.

“Johnny, you see that ship out there,” he says, gesturing to a ship
about a mile out from the dock. “I’ll make you a deal. If you can swim
out to that ship, climb up the mast, and wave to me, I will write you a
check for one million dollars.”

Johnny is awestruck. “You really mean it?!”

“Absolutely,” Mr. Smith confirms.

Johnny dives into the water without a word and swims like a madman. Mr.
Smith watches with a smile on his face, but his smile fades when Johnny
turned around and came back. When Johnny reaches the dock, he explains
he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn’t make it.

“Well that’s ok, Johnny. Tomorrow, let’s meet here, same time, and you
can try again.”

The next day, they meet and Johnny tries again, but once again he gets
fatigued and has to turn back. Mr. Smith asks him if he’d eaten
anything. Johnny tells him he hadn’t. With that, Mr. Smith gives him
money for a meal and tells Johnny tomorrow is his last day in town. If
Johnny is going to succeed, it has to be tomorrow.

The next day, Mr. Smith arrives and Johnny is waiting at the dock with a
smile on his face. “You all fed and ready?” Mr. Smith asks.

“Yes sir,” says Johnny. With that, Johnny dives into the water. This
time he swims a bit slower. He seems to be pacing himself.

Mr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further, and his smile grows
and grows. What a perfect end to a perfect trip, he thinks. He is going
to make a difference in this boy’s life.

Johnny makes it to the ship. Mr. Smith watches him climb up the mast.
Johnny holds on with one hand. He reaches the other out and starts to
wave victoriously, but suddenly he loses his grip! Johnny slips and
falls from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below. He
lands with a loud dull thud that echoes in the distance...

But Johnny survives without injury. Do you know why?

…

…

…

…

…

He’s used to hardships.

Blind {#blind .unnumbered}
=====

Golf {#golf .unnumbered}
----

A priest, a doctor, and an engineer are waiting one morning for a
particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumes, “What’s with
those guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!”

The doctor chimes in, “I don’t know, but I’ve never seen such inept
golf!”

The priest says, “Here comes the greens-keeper. Let’s ask him what’s
going on.”

He says, “Hello, George. What’s wrong with that group ahead of us?
They’re rather slow and are having a lot of trouble.”

The greens-keeper replies, “Oh, yes. That’s a group of blind firemen.
They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we
always let them play for free any time.”

The group falls silent for a moment.

The priest says, “That’s so sad. I will say a special prayer for them
tonight.”

The doctor says, “Good idea. I’ll contact my ophthalmologist colleague
and see if there’s anything she can do for them.”

The engineer says, “Why can’t they play at night?”

Skydiving {#skydiving .unnumbered}
---------

Why don’t blind people go skydiving?

Because it scares the heck out of their dogs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does a blind skydiver know when to pull his chute?

When his seeing eye dog’s leash goes slack.

In a Store {#in-a-store .unnumbered}
----------

A blind guy walks into a store and starts swinging his seeing eye dog
around his head. An employee comes over and nervously asks if he can
help. The blind guy replies, “No thanks. I’m just looking around.”

Drinks with Dogs {#drinks-with-dogs .unnumbered}
----------------

Two men meet in a park while walking their dogs and start chatting. They
hit it off, and after a bit, one says to the other, “Let’s going grab a
drink in that bar!”

The other says, “I’d love to, but I hate leaving my dog outside.”

The first man replies, “Just follow my lead!”

He puts on a pair of dark sunglasses, and walks into the bar with his
dog. The bartender immediately stops him and says, “I’m sorry sir, but
we don’t allow dogs in this bar.” The man replies, “This is my seeing
eye dog. I need him with me.” The bartender lets him have a seat.

The second man decides to try this great strategy. He follows suit with
his own sunglasses. The bartender stops him. The second man uses the
same seeing eye dog line, but the bartender doesn’t buy it.

“Sir, chihuahuas are not seeing eye dogs!”

To which the second man is incredulous, “WHAT?! THEY GAVE ME A
CHIHUAHUA?!”

The Law and Law Breakers {#the-law-and-law-breakers .unnumbered}
========================

The Man Who Loves Trains {#the-man-who-loves-trains .unnumbered}
------------------------

A man in Bulgaria drives a train for a living. He loves his job; driving
a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loves to make
the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he is a little
too reckless and causes a crash. He makes it out, but a single person
dies. Of course, he goes to court over this incident. He is found
guilty, and is sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the
execution comes, he requests a single banana as his last meal. After
eating the banana, the executioner straps him into the electric chair.
The executioner throws the switch, sparks fly, and smoke fills the air -
but nothing happens. The man sits there, perfectly fine.

Well, there is an old Bulgarian law that says a failed execution is a
sign of divine intervention, so the court allows the man to go free. And
somehow, he manages to get his old job back driving the train. Having
not learned his lesson at all, he goes right back to driving the train
with reckless abandon. Once again, he causes the train to crash, this
time killing two people. The new trial goes much the same as the first,
resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man
requests two bananas. After eating the bananas, the executioner straps
the man into the electric chair. The executioner throws the switch,
sparks fly, smoke fills the room - and the man sits there, once again
unharmed.

Well, this of course means that he is free to go. And once again, he
somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the
surprise of no one, he crashes yet another train and kills three people.
And so, he once again finds himself being sentenced to death. On the day
of his execution, he requested his final meal - three bananas.

“You know what? No!” says the executioner. “I’ve had it with you, your
stupid bananas, and walking out of here unharmed. I’m not giving you a
thing to eat. We’re strapping you in and doing this now.” It’s against
protocol, but the executioner straps the man into the electric chair
without a last meal. The executioner throws the switch, sparks fly, and
smoke fills the room - and the man sits there unharmed. The executioner
is speechless.

The man looks at the executioner and says, “Oh, the bananas have nothing
to do with it. I’m just a bad conductor.”

Penguins in a Car {#penguins-in-a-car .unnumbered}
-----------------

A cop sits on the side of the road, checking for speeders. Car flies by,
the cop sees twelve penguins in the back of a car. The cop hits his
sirens and pulls the guy over.

He runs up to the car’s window and yells, “What are you doing with
twelve penguins in the back of your car?!”

The guy says “...I dunno...”

Cop replies, “Well, I think you should bring those penguins to the zoo!”

“OK!” the guy replies.

The next day, the same cop sits on the side of the road again. The same
car flies by with twelve penguins in the back.

The cop hits the sirens, and pulls the guy over again. He runs up to the
car’s window.

“I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO BRING THOSE PENGUINS TO THE ZOO!”

Guy replies “I already did! And now we’re going to the movies!”

Speeding Pope {#speeding-pope .unnumbered}
-------------

One day, the pope is *super* early for his flight. He asks his driver on
his way to the airport if he could drive around for a while, because
they have time to kill, and because he hasn’t driven a car since
becoming pope. Naturally, he’s a bit rusty, and driving is exciting.
He’s driving very fast, when suddenly he sees police lights behind him.
He pulls over, and, when the officer comes up to the window, the
officer’s eyes go wide. He says to the pope, “Hold on a minute.” The
officer goes back to his car to radio the chief.

He says to the chief, “Chief, we have a situation. I’ve pulled over an
important figure.”

The chief replies, “How important? A governor, or something?”

The cop says, “No sir. He’s bigger.”

The chief replies, “Bigger?! A celebrity or something?”

The cop says, “More important, sir.”

The chief replies, “A major politician?”

The cop says, “No sir, he’s much more important.”

The chief replies, “WELL, WHO IS IT!?”

The cop says, “Well... actually, I’m not sure. But the pope’s his
driver.”

Unlicensed Fishing {#unlicensed-fishing .unnumbered}
------------------

A game warden catches an unlicensed fisherman in the act. “You’re going
to pay a big fine for all those fish in your bucket.”

The fisherman replies, “But, officer, I didn’t catch these - they’re my
pet fish, and I just bring them here to swim. When they’re done, they
jump back into the bucket.”

The warden says, “Oh really? This I’ve got to see. If you can prove it,
I’ll let you go.”

The fisherman empties the bucket into the lake and waits patiently. A
few minutes go by and nothing happens. The game warden says, “So where
are the fish?”

The fisherman replies, “What fish?”

Driving Nuns {#driving-nuns .unnumbered}
------------

Sitting on the side of the rural highway, waiting to catch speeding
drivers, a state police officer sees a car puttering along at 22 mph. He
thinks to himself, “This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!”. He
turns on his lights, and pulls the driver over.

Approaching the car, he notices that four very old nuns sitting in it.
One in the front seat, driving, and three in the back - wide-eyed and
white as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, “Officer,
I don’t understand. I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to
be the problem?”

“Sister,” says the officer, “You weren’t speeding, but you should know
that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other
drivers”.

“Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit
exactly... twenty-two miles per hour!” the elderly nun says, a bit
proudly.

The state police officer, trying to contain a chuckle, explains to her
that “22” is the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarassed,
the nun grins and thanks the police officer for pointing out her error.

“But before I let you go ma’am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car
ok? Your sisters seem awfully shaken, and they haven’t uttered a single
peep this whole time,” the officer asks.

“Oh, they will be alright in a minute officer, we just got off Route
119.”

leaves. A few minutes later, when it’s safe, the mathematicians come out

was pretty young. I wanted to help the country, so I told the CIA about
my gift. In no time at all, they had me jetting from country to country,
sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a
dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies for
eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I
knew I wasn’t getting any younger, so I decided to settle down. I signed
up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security wandering
near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible
dealings and was awarded a batch of medals. I got married, had a mess of
puppies, and now I’m just retired.”

Tales About People {#tales-about-people .unnumbered}
==================

Ferrari vs. Moped {#ferrari-vs.-moped .unnumbered}
-----------------

A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available, a brand-new
red Ferrari LaFerrari supercar. It is also the most expensive car in the
world, and it costs him 2.7 million dollars. He takes it out for a spin
and stops for a red light.

An old man, about 75 years old, on a moped pulls up next to him. The old
man looks over at the sleek, red, shiny new car and asks, “What kind of
car ya got there, sonny?”

The young man replies, “A Ferrari LaFerrari supercar. It cost 2.7
million dollars!”

“That’s a lot of money,” says the old man. “Why does it cost so much?”

“Because this car can do up to 217 miles an hour!” states the young man
proudly. The old man asks, “Mind if I take a look inside?”

“No problem,” replies the owner.

The old guy pokes his head in the window and looks around. Then, sitting
back on his moped, he says, “That’s a pretty nice car, all right... but
I’ll stick with my little moped!”

Then the light changes, so the young guy decides to show the old man
just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds the
speedometer reads 120 mph. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rearview
mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it
could be, and suddenly, WHHHOOOOSSSHHH! Something whips by him, going
much faster.

“What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?!” the young man
asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 160
mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it’s the old man on the moped.

Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it some more gas
and passes the moped at 180 mph. WHHOOOOSSSHH! He’s feeling pretty good
until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again.
Astounded by the speed of this old guy, he floors the gas pedal and
takes the LaFerrari all the way up to 217 mph.

Not 10 seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again. The
Ferrari is flat out and there’s nothing he can do.

The young man slows down and pulls over. The old man follows, but looks
white as a ghost and is completely out of breath. The young man
stammers, “H-h-how did you keep up with my LaFerrari?!” The old man
whispers “Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your... side-view...
mirror.”

to order his food, the bowl of tortilla chips in front of him says,
“Hey, you’re a handsome fellow.”

The man tries to ignore the chips, and goes to get a soda from
self-serve drink machine. The drink machine yells at him, “Get away from
me, you ugly troll!”

The man is frightened and runs back to his table with his drink. The
chips say, “Ooooh! That drink looks delicious. Great choice. You’re a
very smart man.”

Starting to freak out, the guy says to the waiter, “Hey, what the heck!
The soda machine yelled at me, and this bowl of chips keeps saying nice
things to me!”

The waiter says, “Don’t worry about it. The tortilla chips are
complimentary and the drink machine is out-of-order.”

up his hair. He then marches back into the pub and orders again. The
bartender asks, “Aren’t you that same string that ordered earlier?” The
string replies, “No, I’m a frayed knot.”
